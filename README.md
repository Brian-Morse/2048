# 2048

This is a custom-sized implementation of the classic 2048 game, written in Java. Simply run the .jar file to play

You can choose to either play in the standard 4x4 game screen or a positive size of your choosing (even a 1x1!)

When playing, the score will be tracked by the game and even after closing, the high score for the given size will be saved for when you play it again
